# Price Optimization Analysis Using Random Forest

## Overview

This project analyzes pricing and sales data for our store versus the competition, using data visualization and machine learning to recommend an optimal pricing strategy.

We use visual analytics and Random Forest Regression to determine the best price point that maximizes revenue while remaining competitive.

## Project Goals

- Explore price and sales quantity relationships
- Compare price distributions between our store and the competition
- Build a predictive ML model to estimate sales amount
- Simulate and recommend an optimal price
- Provide actionable business insights

## Tools Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Key Result

- **Recommended Optimal Price:** KSh 168  
- **Maximum Predicted Revenue:** KSh 71,181.60


## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for each stage
- `data/`: Input dataset (Competition_Data.csv)
- `images/`: Exported charts for reporting
